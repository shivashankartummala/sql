Write an SQL Query to check whether date passed to Query is the date of given format or not.

SQL has IsDate() function which is used to check passed value is a date or not of specified format, it returns 1(true) or 0(false) accordingly. Remember ISDATE() is an MSSQL function and it may not work on Oracle, MySQL or any other database but there would be something similar.

SELECT  ISDATE('1/08/13') AS "MM/DD/YY"; 

It will return 0 because passed date is not in correct format.
